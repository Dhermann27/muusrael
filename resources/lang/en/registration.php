                                  welcomes everyone regardless of their biological sex or gender
                                  identification. We ask that you include your pronoun

                                  campers into one of two cabins in accordance with Missouri
                                  state law. Please contact us to make special arrangements for
                                  any camper who would prefer alternatives.</p>

                                  strongly suggest that you seek out your own roommate using

                   of time that the camper will be on YMCA property. A sponsor is asked to attend
                   the informational meetings in the parents\' stead, and if the camper is asked to
                   leave for any reason, the sponsor will be required to assist the camper home.</p>

                   Contact Us form above. Oftentimes, we have adults in your area who are willing to
                   volunteer, and may also be willing to offer transportation.</p>',
