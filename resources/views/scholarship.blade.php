                        toward camp expenses, and partnering with YMCA of the Ozarks (which operates Trout Lodge) to
                        offer scholarship funds.</p>

                    <h3 class="pb-2">Timing</h3>
                    <p>The Scholarship process will open on February 1. Campers seeking financial assistance
                        must submit scholarship applications no later than April 15. The timeline for the
                        process is as follows:</p>
                    <table>
                        <tbody>

                        their award by May 15, barring unforeseen delays. Balances of camper invoices on the

                    <h4 class="pb-2">Review and Award of Scholarships</h4>
                    <p>The scholarship process will be administered by the MUUSA Scholarship Committee, which
                        includes: Sarah Lensink, Sara Teppema, John Sandman, and Bill Pokorny for
                        MUUSA {{ $year->year }}. Sarah Lensink will serve as the Scholarship Committee Coordinator and
                        the primary contact for the Scholarship Committee.</p>
                    <p>Upon receipt of the YMCA's determinations, the Scholarship Committee will review all
                        applications and independently determine how available scholarship funds will be
                        allocated.</p>
                    <p>Scholarships will be awarded based upon the following criteria:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>YMCA scholarship determinations</li>
                        <li>Welcoming new campers who have not previously had an opportunity to attend MUUSA
                        </li>
                        <li>Interest in attending MUUSA and being part of the MUUSA community</li>
                        <li>Availability of funds</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To make the process as fair as possible, members of the Scholarship Committee will recuse
                        themselves from any decision involving a scholarship application by a family member or
                        close friend.</p>
                    <p>The Scholarship Committee has sole discretion to determine whether to award a scholarship
                        and in what amount. The Committee's decisions are final.</p>
                    <h4 class="pb-2">Scholarship Amounts</h4>
                    <p>For {{ $year->year }}, the total scholarship amounts awarded will initially be capped on
                        a per-camper (not per-family) basis. The maximum scholarship awards will be as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>Adults (including YAs): $500 per person<br/> Children and Youth age 6 and up: $300 per
                        person<br/> Children under age 6: $70 per person</p>
                    <p>Please note that these are maximum awards. In many cases a lower scholarship amount may
                        be awarded so as to share available funds among a broader group of applicants.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, scholarships awarded will not exceed total fees after all additions and
                        reductions (including staff honoraria) less $100 for each adult camper (including YAs)
                        in Trout Lodge, Lakeview or Forest View, and $50 for each adult (including YAs) in
                        Lakewood or tent camping. In other words, all adults receiving MUUSA scholarship funds
                        will pay at least $100 or $50 (depending on housing) for their week at camp, regardless
                        of honoraria.</p>
                    <p>Scholarship amounts do not apply toward additional MUUSA workshop or class fees, such as
                        the float trip or supplies for the fabric workshop.</p>
                    <p>The Scholarship Committee may adjust the caps and minimum charges listed above for
                        recipients of YMCA scholarships if the Treasurer projects that MUUSA will receive YMCA
                        scholarship credits in excess of the above amounts after exceeding its minimum guarantee
                        to Trout Lodge. Please refer to the appendix for more information on the minimum
                        guarantee, how YMCA scholarship funds are applied, and sample scholarship
                        calculations.</p>
                    <h4 class="pb-2">Why Would I Take on a Staff Role at MUUSA if I am Applying for a
                        Scholarship?</h4>
                    <p>Choosing to serve in a MUUSA staff role allows you to give back to the MUUSA community in
                        a way that best reflects your skills and talents. Whether you choose to lead a workshop,
                        assist in the Children's Program, or fill another crucial role, you are providing a
                        valuable contribution to the MUUSA community. Furthermore, funding for staff honoraria
                        is included in the MUUSA budget whereas scholarships (and their amounts) are subject to
                        availability.</p>

                    <h3>Appendix</h3>
                    <h4>Where Do Scholarship Funds Come From?</h4>
                    <p>MUUSA scholarships provide a discount off of the fees that MUUSA would otherwise charge a
                        camper for their stay. Because MUUSA has to cover its financial obligations, the money
                        that we are not collecting from campers who receive scholarships must be made up from
                        some other source. Scholarship funds may come from two sources: YMCA of the Ozarks and
                        MUUSA's own scholarship fund. Understanding how these two sources work together requires
                        some understanding of our (MUUSA's) financial obligations to Trout Lodge.</p>
                    <p>Campers pay MUUSA for their week at camp. The revenue we receive from campers covers our
                        fees to Trout Lodge (for food, lodging, Trout Lodge staff, etc.) and MUUSA expenses (for
                        program staff, supplies, insurance, etc.). Our contract with Trout Lodge obligates MUUSA
                        to pay a certain minimum guaranteed amount to Trout Lodge (the &quot;minimum guarantee&quot;),
                        regardless of how many campers register or our actual revenue. Paying the minimum
                        guarantee allows MUUSA to retain exclusive rights to the Trout Lodge property.We have
                        not met the minimum guaranteein some years, or met it by only a very small margin, even
                        though camp has been nearly full. This is because Trout Lodge bases the minimum
                        guarantee on a higher occupancy rate (i.e., more campers per room) than we achieve.</p>
                    <p>The YMCA of the Ozarks has funding to provide a limited number of scholarships to MUUSA
                        campers who may not otherwise be able to afford a camp experience. These scholarships do
                        not go directly to the camper or MUUSA. Rather, they operate as a percentage discount
                        off of what Trout Lodge would otherwise charge MUUSA for that camper's stay. However,
                        the YMCA provides these discounts only once MUUSA's minimum guarantee is met. In other
                        words, YMCA scholarships only benefit MUUSA campers to the extent that our enrollment is
                        high enough to exceed our minimum guarantee with Trout Lodge. Even if we exceed the
                        guarantee by more than the value of the scholarships awarded, YMCA scholarships do not
                        cover the other MUUSA expenses paid for by our camp fees.</p>
                    <p>MUUSA has its own scholarship fund that we use to provide additional assistance with camp
                        costs not covered by YMCA scholarships. These funds come mainly from voluntary donations
                        from MUUSA campers and through fundraising. MUUSA's main scholarship fundraising sources
                        have historically included donations paid as part of the registration process, a portion
                        of MUUSA bookstore profits (if any), and art show sales.</p>
                    <p>Each year, the Treasurer and Registrar will review the balance in the Scholarship Fund as
                        well as MUUSA's projected enrollment and revenue. They will then recommend an amount to
                        be included in the budget for scholarship awards. The amount available for distribution
                        will be included in the budget approved by the Planning Council, and will be finalized
                        before scholarship awards are communicated to campers.</p>
